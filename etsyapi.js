    "description": "The MAPLE TACO  wooden spoon was hand carved by Spoontaneous from a weathered old piece of &#39;lace&#39; maple. \r\n\r\nOne of the jewelry artists from Etsy contacted me recently, letting me know she had a couple of large boxes of wood cut-offs which had been left behind by her woodturning ex-husband. She wondered if I would be interested in purchasing them since she lived within an hours drive.\r\n\r\nI was planning a trip down to Miami the next weekend anyway to visit one of the botanical gardens. It was easy enough to swing by and pick up the wood. This spoon is the first to come from that wood.\r\n\r\nThe exterior on this piece of wood had a nice texture and was already shaped somewhat like a spoon. I basically dug out the bowl and evened up the rest of it. The top of the handle I left with the natural texture, while the back of the spoon and inside the spoon bowl are finished.\r\n\r\nThe wood was fairly porous and I had to use several coats of finish to give the effect I wanted. I liked the contrast between the raw wood and the finished wood and wanted to emphasize that.\r\n\r\nThe spoon is 8 7\/8&quot; long and the bowl is 2 7\/8&quot; at the widest. The bowl actually is a sort of &#39;V&#39; shape and reminds me a bit of a taco. The handle has a hole or two, one of which penetrates all the way through.\r\n\r\nFinished with the decorative (not food safe) finish.\r\n\r\nShips Priority Mail.\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look.",

I like to make sure everything is laid out before you make your purchase.\r\n\u2022 Please select your style and size, and colour from the drop down menu or if on a mobile device please write a message in the &quot;notes to seller&quot; section. \r\n\u2022 Please look over the shipping costs before you buy an item. I am in Canada so shipping may be a little more then buying stateside. But trust me - it&#39;s worth it! Shipment costs to receive the awesome t-shirts are at the buyer&#39;s expense.\r\n\u2022 If you have any questions please ask! I normally respond in an hour or two as I am home with kids.\r\n\r\n\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\r\n\r\nSHIPPING & RETURNS\r\n\r\nMost orders will ship within 1 business day. If \u00a0for some reason we can&#39;t get the item out within\u00a024 hours, we will contact you directly.\r\n\r\nUSA --- Shipping from Canada to the USA on average is 5 -14 days.\r\n\u2028CANADA --- Shipping From Canada from GTA is standard postal times.\u2028\r\nWORLD WIDE --- Shipping from Canada to international destinations on average will take 7 - 21 days.\r\n\r\nShipping time depends on how long the\u00a0postal system in your country holds an item at customs for inspection. Please note that due to a lack of security within certain postal systems we will not ship to Brazil, Italy, Russia, UAE. We reserve the right to refund and cancel transactions if the shipping country is not advisable.\r\n\r\nOn all exchanges (new colour\/new size) you pay the shipping to return it to me, and when I receive it, I will pay the shipping to send you the replacement. All refunds are minus shipping costs. If I have made an error (doesn&#39;t happen often, but I&#39;m human!) then I will pay shipping to return the incorrect item and to replace it with a new one. Custom designed and personalized name\/year tees are final sale with no exchange or refund.\u00a0THERE IS NO PROBLEM THAT CAN&#39;T BE SOLVED!\r\n\r\n\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\r\n\r\nAll the best to you and yours and thank you for shopping with me!

I will try to get back with your changes within 24 hours, but once in a while it will take 48 hours, depending on how backed up we are.  I do not respond to convos on weekends or after work hours.\r\n\r\nOnce you&#39;ve approve the final proof and made final payment, it takes 10-13  business days to print and ship.  The whole process takes about 4 weeks, which of course can be sped up if your in a hurry. For international orders, it takes 4-6 weeks for the whole process.  See below for specific printing and shipping timelines.\r\n\r\nAdd another week for custom orders.\r\n\r\nGETTING STARTED\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\nSTEP ONE: \r\nPurchase the listing for the design of your choice.

After that, we&#39;ll go through the design process until you are 100% happy with your design. I will then set up a custom listing in my shop for your to purchase.  The order will be sent in to print as soon as the payment has been made.",

I was a huge Rainbow Bright fan and just loved the Sprites. This guy has his tag that shows his name and even how to speak his language. It&#39;s cute. It&#39;s about 6&quot; or so. No flaws to mention. \r\n\r\nTruly vintage and oh so cute!! \r\n\r\nI check these vintage items over very closely and will note any flaws. They are rarely new in their package, so please assume they were used lovingly and are in such condition. I wouldn&#39;t sell anything I wouldn&#39;t use or display in my own home. \r\n\r\nI am a lover and seller of all things vintage. I long for a time when a home was filled with a lovely, feminine touch and was a place for families to enjoy each other.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Although I&#39;m always eager to get orders out the door asap, life happens and it can sometimes take up to three days to pack up your order and hand it over to the friendly postman - so if you would like it quick quick just let me know and I&#39;ll do my very best!!\r\n\r\nI do not send a printed receipt with your package unless one is requested, so let me know if you&#39;d like one.\r\n\r\nUnless you have upgraded to faster\/tracked delivery, I post all overseas orders via regular airmail.  From the day after I\u2019ve posted your mail, it usually takes three more days to reach Western Europe, five days to Eastern Europe and seven days to the rest of the world.  If you need your order before this time, please message me and I can arrange to upgrade your order to a slightly faster service.  \r\n\r\nThe UK Royal Mail do not give tracking numbers.
